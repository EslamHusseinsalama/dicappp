# dicappp

Welcome to the Dicee Flutter project! This project is designed to help you create a mobile app that emulates rolling dice using the Flutter framework.
## Getting Started

In this project, you will be asked to create a mobile app that allows the user to roll dice by tapping on the screen. The app will display two dice and generate random numbers for each dice when the user taps on the screen. The app will also allow the user to shake their device to generate new random numbers for the dice.
